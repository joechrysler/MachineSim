Machine Simulator is a simple project built for my CS331 class at SVSU.

It simulates...wait for it...a machine.  Specifically, in this case, an x86 assembler machine (at&t syntax of course).

Most of this was written by Dr. Hansen, who has saved us all from the certain doom that was CS446 next semester. Yay Hansen!
I added a few bits here and there to spruce it up in time for submission.
